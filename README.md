# Real Estate House Price Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices in the real estate market using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). By analyzing key factors that influence property prices, the project provides accurate and actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## Objectives
1. Predict house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.
2. Identify key variables affecting real estate prices.
3. Provide a scalable solution for real-world real estate price prediction.

## Features of the Dataset
- **Location**: Area or city where the property is located.
- **Size**: Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and total square footage.
- **Amenities**: Presence of facilities like parking, garden, etc.
- **Price**: Target variable representing the price of the house.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered historical real estate data from reliable sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized and identified patterns in data.
4. **Model Building**: Implemented and optimized a Multiple Linear Regression model.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like R-squared and RMSE.

## Key Findings
- Location significantly impacts house prices.
- Larger houses with modern amenities command higher prices.
- The model achieves an R-Squared Value **70.29** with p-Value **0.0003**
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
